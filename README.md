# Purpose and Functionality

# Instructions
To begin use with the breadboard design the user must connect the stm microcontroller to the following pins. Red 5v to the 5v pin. Black gnd to the gnd pin. Yellow first yellow wire to the SCL pin. Orange wire to SDA pin. Second yellow wire to the 3v pin. 

After connecting all the neccessary wires the user must then plug in the transmitter to power and turn on transmitter. At this point the LED's on the breakout boards should be on and the transmitter LED should be on. The user can then turn on the RC car and adjust the trim potentiometers on the transmitter to ensure alignment is correct. After this the care should be fully functional.
